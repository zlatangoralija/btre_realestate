### BT REAL-ESTATE 

## Introduction
Hello. This is my first Django project. It represents a simple real-estate application, which is composed out of two main parts: 
1. Admin panel, for administration purposes
2. User panel, for regular users

#### Admin panel main functions: 
1. Add new realtors
2. Add new properties to the listings and assign them to realtors
3. Edit & delete properties & realtors
4. Preview user contacts that were submitted for a property
5. Set an employee of a month


#### User panel main functions:
1. Browse listings
2. Listing filtering
3. Create an inquiry for a listing
